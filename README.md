# fraud-detection-using-SOM
this model is based on self organizing maps and artificial neural networks, the model is trained with the list of customers in the bank who had applied for credit card and this dataset is trained on som model and a map is formed from that map you need to select which has the most MID(mean inter neuron distance) and concatenate the mappings and finally the result is obtained from mappings, all the customers who are fraud now became a list now we take a simple ann and train the dataset without user id's and with user ids are now transformed into an array of zero's and this is concatenated with the list of fraud people which completely transforms the list into zeros and one's which was predicted by som and now ann is trained with this model and result is stored with the probabilities of customers being fraud, the ann consists only single hidden layer and batch size of 1 and epochs 2 as the data is very small, the main goal is here to combine the UNSUPERVISED MODEL to SUPERVISED MODEL, the dataset is obtained from UCI machine learning library.
